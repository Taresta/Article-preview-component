### What I learned
I had basically forgotten how to use sass after a month of abandoning it. So, this project was a good refresher. Again had a good time practising fluent design. You can learn all the theory but only by building real projects, we truly test our skills. I always feel that maybe now I have a grid at responsive design, but every project does challenge this believe. So, it was pretty good. I also learnt the use of classList object in JavaScript and how by simply adding and removing classes I could obtain the results that I wanted.
```
```js
if (window.innerWidth < 768 ) {
        avatarContainer.classList.toggle('hidden');
        shareContainer.classList.toggle('hidden');
        footerContainer.classList.toggle('dark');
        
        } 

```


### Continued development
JavaScript is a vast topic and I hope to continue to learn various aspects of it as I continue my journey with my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN: JavaScript Fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/javascript-fundamentals/) - This really helped me understand the basics.
